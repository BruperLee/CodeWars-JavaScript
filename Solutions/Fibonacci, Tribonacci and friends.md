## **Fibonacci, Tribonacci and friends**
### **6 kyu**

題目如下:

If you have completed the Tribonacci sequence kata, you would know by now that mister Fibonacci has at least a bigger brother. If not, give it a quick look to get how things work.

Well, time to expand the family a little more: think of a Quadribonacci starting with a signature of 4 elements and each following element is the sum of the 4 previous, a Pentabonacci (well Cinquebonacci would probably sound a bit more italian, but it would also sound really awful) with a signature of 5 elements and each following element is the sum of the 5 previous, and so on.

Well, guess what? You have to build a Xbonacci function that takes a signature of X elements - and remember each next element is the sum of the last X elements - and returns the first n elements of the so seeded sequence.

```javascript
xbonacci {1,1,1,1} 10 = {1,1,1,1,4,7,13,25,49,94}
xbonacci {0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {0,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,8,16}
xbonacci {1,0,0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,6}
xbonacci {1,1} produces the Fibonacci sequence
```


>個人解法:

```javascript
function Xbonacci(signature,n){
  let i, j, temp;
  const length = signature.length;
  
  for (i = 0; i < (n - length); i++) {
    temp = 0;
    for (j = i; j < i + length; j++) {
      temp += signature[j];
    }
    signature.push(temp);
  }
  
  return signature.slice(0, n);
}
```
>其他人解法:

```javascript
const Xbonacci = (sig, n) => {
  let len = sig.length;
  for (let i = len; i < n; i++) 
    sig[i] = sig.slice(i - len).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  return sig.slice(0, n);
}
```
